0x02-functions_nested_loops

#functions, nested loops

Poject done during "Full Stack Software Engineering Boot Camp" at ALX School, aiming to learn about header files, functions, loops and nested loops in *C language.

##TECHNOLOGIES USED

C files are compiled using gcc 4.8.4
C files are written according to C90 standard
Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
Code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
###Learning Objectives

What are nested loops and how to use them
What is a function and how do you use functions
What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
What is a prototype
Scope of variables
What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89
What are header files and how to to use them with #include
